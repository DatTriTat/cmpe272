## ‚úÖ Testing & Code Quality --- BONUS POINTS

### üìå Static Analysis (Linting)

To maintain code quality and enforce consistent style across the backend, we used **ESLint**:

- Detects syntax errors, unreachable code, and unused variables
- Enforces best practices with modern ES module standards
- Helps prevent bugs before runtime

#### üîß Run ESLint:
```bash
cd resume-analyze/server
npx eslint .
npx eslint . --fix
```
### üß™ Unit Testing with Code Coverage

We implemented unit tests using **Vitest**, and used **C8** to measure code coverage.

Test cases cover:
- Input validation
- AI-driven logic (mocked)
- MongoDB session persistence (mocked)
