Platform for Reskilling Laid-Off Federal Employees for Private Sector Careers

Problem:
Laid-off federal employees face challenges transitioning into private-sector jobs due to differences in job requirements, skills, and hiring expectations.

Solution:
Develop a digital platform to help former federal employees reskill and transition into new roles by:

Use MongoDB to take user input (prior experience, job title, skill set).
Use OpenAI or Deepseek for:
  Recommending private sector jobs based on transferable skills and local job market trends.
  Suggesting online courses (Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning) tailored to bridge skill gaps.
  Providing interview preparation with industry-specific questions and AI-driven coaching.

Target Audience:
Former federal employees, especially those in procurement, administration, IT, and policy roles (e.g., USAID, DoD, DHS).
